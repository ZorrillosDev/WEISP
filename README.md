Watchit Enhancement/Improvement Proposals

This repository is a collection of SCPs to improve Watchit - detailed ideas intended solicit discussion that leads to consensus.

SCP Process
All ideas are welcome. An SCP should start as a pull request to this repo. Merged SCP should be considered "finalized" and ready for development.

See the current listing of in-progress SCPs [here](https://github.com/ZorrillosDev/WEWIP/pulls)

Process Status: experimental
This process is itself in flux and may change or end at some point.

### Numbering

SCPs should be numbered the same as the pull request which they are introduced.
eg. SCP-001: My Proposal

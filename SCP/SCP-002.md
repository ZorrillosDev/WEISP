# SCP-002: Using system installation of IPFS instead of the bundled binary

## Catagory: Architecture

### Background
IPFS can use lots of system resources at times, having two instances of it running may cause poor performance on lower-end computers and shorter battery life in laptops. One solution would be to use the system installation of IPFS.

### Proposal
1. Keep including the bundled IPFS binary for anyone who doesn't have IPFS installed
2. Scan the PATH for IPFS
3. If IPFS is detected on the PATH, check to see if it is running; if IPFS is not detected start the bundled version
4. If IPFS is already running, use it, if not, start it
